Teams which make decisions own the results of those decisions. So, hire good people
and trust them to make good decisions. It's really that simple.

Well, trust them, but not enough to decide which programming language to use.
After all, you might want to hire people in the future that don't want to learn a
language they aren't familiar with.

Also, you think your teams will just pick some fad and spend a long time screwing around
with it before they get any work done.

So let's take language off the table. Language choice isn't that important
anyway. What we use today will be hot in the market forever anyway, right?

Though, we do have that aging RPG/COBOL/VB/FORTAN codebase. It's downright
impossible to find people who are willing to work on that thing anymore. But, that was a
fluke. No, wait, that wasn't a fluke but you think these new hipster languages are
going to go the way of RPG. Not the one we've selected. That one will be around
forever.

So, yeah, language choice won't be a team decision. We'll make sure that's
consistent across teams because we've picked a winner.

And, really, I mean really, is one language more suited to any given problem
than any other language? They're all Turing complete, right? All that matters is
what the code can do, not how you express what it does.

So, hire good people and get them to trust you. You don't need to trust them,
really.
